					<h2>WebAssembly and the Elusive Universal Binary</h2>

            A "Universal Binary" is a single executable that
            runs on any arch and any OS, and
            runs at 100% of speed.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            The dream is you build once instead of for each target, and
            despite having a single portable build, it's not noticeably slower.
          </p>
          <hr>
					<p>
            Of course this is just a dream. But how close can we get?
(explain intuition: annoying we have to worry about arch and OS differences)
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
            The closest thing is probably JavaScript, which can run on any
            Web browser and also on the server, and it works remarkably well
            across those.
          </p>
          <hr>
					<p>
            But JS isn't a "binary" format, and it it is at a different speed
            level than the "universal binary" intuition. Ditto Python.
          </p>

					<p>
            Java and .NET are fast and close to this idea. But they also are
            not binary formats, and have some overhead - in particular, startup.
          </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
            The languages we mean by "binary" are things like C++, Rust, Swift,
            Go, etc. They have almost no startup delay, and they end to be
            fast. But those binaries are not portable.
          </p>

            Is WebAssembly the solution?
